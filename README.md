## 🚀 What’s Inside?  

### **1️⃣ API Gateway Middleware**  
Manages routing, authentication, and request handling for microservices. Ensures **secure, efficient API communication**.  

### **2️⃣ Authentication & Security**  
- **JWT-based authentication & role-based authorization (RBAC)**.  
- Secure APIs using **ASP.NET Core Identity**.  

### **3️⃣ Centralized Logging**  
- **Serilog integration** for **structured logging** and distributed tracing.  
- Logs **requests, responses, and exceptions** in a consistent format.  

### **4️⃣ Global Exception Middleware**  
Ensures that all unhandled exceptions are logged and transformed into meaningful API responses.  

### **5️⃣ Database Connections**  
- **Pre-configured EF Core/PostgreSQL** integration.  
- **Repository pattern** for clean data access management.  

### **6️⃣ Observability & Health Monitoring**  
- Integrated **Health Checks** to monitor service health.  
- Supports **Prometheus/Grafana for real-time metrics tracking**.
